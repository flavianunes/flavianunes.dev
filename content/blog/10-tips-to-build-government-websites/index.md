I've been building government websites for a year and a half and during this time I've learned a lot about it and would like to share.


## 1. Define who your user is
Is your website GTC (government to citizen), GTG (government to government) or GTB (governemnt to business)? All of them? Dependending on who your user is, your content and the way you organize it may change. 

If you're focussing on citizen, you may want to showcase services and informations in an easy-to-find easy-to-understand way. If it's business, you need to convice them to do business with you, showing everything they need to know and do to make it happen.  

## 2. Focus on what your user is looking for

The hierarchy of your content maters. Think about what your public (citizen, government, business) are looking for when visiting your website. Which of your services are the most requested? If you already have a website, you can check which pages are the most visited using Google Analytics for example. You can also survey your current users asking if they believe something is missing on the current website. [How to define a successful content hierarchy
](https://gathercontent.com/blog/define-successful-content-hierarchy) is a good guide.  



## 3. Make it accessible
Some places in the world have laws about it (Brazil, for example), but even if it doesn't: make your website accessible for all citizens is a must, since you don't want to exclude people from accessing important information and services. Specially if some of them may be exclusively accessible via your website.
A great resource is [The A11Y Project](https://a11yproject.com), [a11y with Lindsey](https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com) by Lindsey Kopacz and the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

For quick automated evaluation, I use the [WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org) browser extension. Although automated evaluations are helpful, they don't exclude the need of user evaluation. [Involving Users in Evaluating Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/involving-users/) can help you with this.


## 4. Get inspiration
My favorites government websites for inspirations are [Gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk) (it also includes a [great design system](https://design-system.service.gov.uk)) and [Québec](https://www.quebec.ca/en/).

## 5. Make things easy to find
You want to make it easy and fast to find a specific service or information. 

* ### Build a good search engine
* ### Highlight important information

* ### Have a sitemap

## 6. Make it light
Government websites usually have a lot of information, but you should keep in mind that sometimes your user may need to access a service/information in an emergency with low connection. 

## 7. Gather feedback
User evaluation is a must, but you can also gather feedback by having a place on your website where users can give feedback about it in general, or about an expecific page. You can add "was this useful?" voting to your pages to see if any of them are missleading or have incomplete information, for example. This is a way to keep improving your website, with real users inputs about it.
