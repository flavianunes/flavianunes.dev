ARIEL is being developed to share knowledge, motivate and empower Brazilian women learning front-end development. The main goal is to contribute to a more diverse tech community. 

The chatbot's UX was designed during the [Future Learn](https://www.futurelearn.com/) "Design a Feminist Chatbot" course and it's being implemented with vanilla JavaScript, Sass and Gulp. The simple stack is meant to be beginner friendly for its users.

ARIEL can help them with:

* <strong>Motivation</strong>: shares motivational content aimed at women in tech
* <strong>Technical content</strong>: shares with users information about topics related to front-en, such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and links to useful resources about those topics.
* <strong>Exercises</strong>: shares exercises and challenges based on topics that users would like to practice
* <strong>Feedback</strong>: has areas where the user can ask for a specific content or give feedback about the chatbot
