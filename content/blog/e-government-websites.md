During my time working as a web developer at Ouro Preto City Hall I've designed and developed a few e-government websites with focus on the citizen. I also evaluated the main website's usability and accessibility from an e-gov perspective, using System Usability Scale, Heuristic Evaluation, automated and human accessibility evaluations.

The results where presented with an in dept analysis and the prototype for a new website, inspired by the [official website of the Gouvernement du Qu√©bec](https://www.quebec.ca/en/) and [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk). Besides the new website, the project also has a simple design system with the goals to make all websites consistent in the future. 

This project is currently in development.
