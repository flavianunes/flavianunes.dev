During my time working as a web developer at Ouro Preto City Hall, I've designed and developed a few e-government websites with a focus on the citizen.

I also evaluated the main website's usability and accessibility from an e-gov perspective, using the System Usability Scale, Heuristic Evaluation, and automated plus human accessibility evaluations.

The results were presented with an in-depth analysis and the prototype for a new website, inspired by the [official website of the Gouvernement du Qu√©bec](https://www.quebec.ca/en/) and [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk). Besides the new website, the project also has a simple design system with the goals to make all websites consistent in the future.

Most websites were developed using Node.js, Express, MySQL database, Gulp, jQuery, and Bootstrap.
