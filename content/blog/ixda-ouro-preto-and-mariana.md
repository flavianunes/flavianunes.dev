During my time as an IxDA local leader (2018-2019), I helped planning events and meetups to bring discussion about interaction design to two cities of Minas Gerais: Ouro Preto and Mariana.

Some of those events were:

* <strong>IxDA on the road - Congonhas</strong>, where we brought a discussion about interaction design to a city without an IxDA chapter (Congonhas/Minas Gerais). The talks were mainly about citizen focus design, design thinking, and smart cities.
* <strong>Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)</strong>, where we discussed the importance of accessible interfaces, how to design, develop, and test them.
* <strong>Startup Weekend Mariana</strong>, an event to influence technological innovation in Mariana city, after [Brumadinho's disaster](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-51220373).
